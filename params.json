{"name":"Opendomo-cgi","tagline":"The main interface for OpenDomo 2.0","body":"Web interface for OpenDomo\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nOpenDomo-CGI (a.k.a odcgi) is the main interface for [OpenDomo](http://www.opendomo.com) and it's bundled within the Operative System. However, this project intends to replace it with a plug-in, to offer the following advantages:\r\n\r\n* **Avoid compilation** and replace the current binary with a Python script. Quick deployment, easy modification.\r\n* **Good-by, cross-dependencies!** Too many libraries required, source code, for a simple executable.\r\n* **Edit and test.** With a Python-based CGI we can modify the executable and refresh the browser to see the changes.\r\n* **Full integration with scripts.** OpenDomo's features are based on a scripting layer (typically shellscript) but Python can also be used if desired, offering a better coupling. \r\n* **Make it modular!** Instead of enlarging the binary, we can provide complementary features as Python modules that can be installed whenever the user needs them.\r\n\r\nChallenges\r\n----------\r\n* **Manage user privileges.** The current CGI has a clear separation of privileges per user. It may be complicated to do so in Python.\r\n* **Performance.** An optimized CGI can be really fast even with limited resources. Interpreted languages are slower.\r\n","google":"UA-13280727-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
